          <p class="story-text">
            I've always found skincare very fascinating since childhood.
            Watching Youtube videos and seeing the way girls' skin would glow
            from using face products tempted me to save every buck I had and
            walk to the nearest Target or Walmart to buy a face mask, face wash,
            or acne treatment. I would run home and quickly indulge my skin in
            the products. It was so exhilarating to have what I thought was a
            luxurious product on my skin.
          </p>
          <p class="story-text">
            The products gave a tingling sensation making me feel like my skin
            was undergoing a magical spell to reveal flawless skin that shimmers
            with dewy radiance like the girls I saw on Youtube.
          </p>
          <p class="story-text">Oh, was I wrong.</p>
          <p class="story-text">
            My skin became far from flawless. My cheeks were suffused with
            blemishes and painful, inflamed red-ringed pustules.

          <p class="story-text">
            Growing up as a person of color with very dry skin and severe acne,
            there weren't many products on the shelves that could tackle my skin
            issues. The few products that were on the shelves or that
            dermatologists recommended to me had no beneficial impact on my
            face.
          </p>
          <p class="story-text">
            I lost all hope of improving my skin and my self confidence
            worsened. The humiliation and dirty looks from other people was
            unbearable. The fear that boys would not be interested in me until
            the Gusher-like bumps on my face popped pushed me to take initiative
            to intensively research.
          </p>
          <p class="story-text">
            I made products that helped me cure & restore my skin. Not only did
            it restore my skin, but it restored my happiness and gave me back my
            confidence!

          "I've struggled with sensitive skin for years and tried countless
          products that either didn't work or irritated my skin. GLOW
          Beauty's products have been a game-changer. They're gentle but
          effective, and for the first time in my life, I feel confident in
          my skin."
